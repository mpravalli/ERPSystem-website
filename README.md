I build a sample dashboard, product and order pages by using html, css and  Javascript with no backend only frontend.
Running process is First run index.html.I use external css in this file that file name is style.css.
The HomePage with dashboard will open.
if you choose product tab will open in that page there are 4 products is there if you want more details about product there is individual pages for each product. If you click more details in the product page that individual page will open.
if you click on buynow button in the product page it will open shipping details form you enter your details then click submit then your order details will shown in order page.
if you click on order tab then it will shows some order details and it display recent order details.There is back button in all pages for to come the home page.
